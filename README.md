## Home Dashboard

The current list of features enabled is below, but is not an exhaustive list. Over the course of development this has been pared down to essentials and to show a more minimal interface so as to be more attractive on the wall of a living room or common hallway area of a home. Previous ugliness revolved around a BTC price graph, SF Giants standings (2014 when they won the WS, naturally). So I think the last time this was run was around early 2015 or so.

### Current Main Template Display Modules

- Weather Forecast and today's temp in F° and C°.
- Bus Lines arrival info for next 2 buses per line
- Bitcoin Price and Volume information
- Time and Date for US Pacific and Korean Standaard Time Zones
