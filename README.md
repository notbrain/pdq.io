## Home Dashboard

The current list of features enabled is below, but is not an exhaustive list. Over the course of development this has been pared down to essentials and to show a more minimal interface so as to be more attractive on the wall of a living room or common hallway area of a home. Previous ugliness revolved around a BTC price graph, SF Giants standings (2014 when they won the WS, naturally). So I think the last time this was run was around early 2015 or so.

### Current Main Template Display Modules

- Weather Forecast and today's temp in F° and C°.
- Bus Lines arrival info for next 2 buses per line
- Bitcoin Price and Volume information
- Time and Date for US Pacific and Korean Standaard Time Zones

#### 1920x1080px

## Installation

Do not use this application. See intrinsicbits/pdq-vue and intrinsicbits/pdq-api for the new version of this project.

## Previous Incarnation

The previous edition of this dashboard had a couple extras, but as you can see below, the visual design was not really a factor. It was more about data density, how much information can you pack into a single 1920x1080 screen but not overwhelm your ability to glance and quickly find something out. Things that will be moved to the new app will be:

- Bitcoin price tracker
- Grid calendar - the unlabeled grid rectangle with the dayglo green mark is a grid of 365/6 squares that represent all the days in the year. Meant to convey your position in the year and to--over time--realize that time is precious. Similar to a life expectancy clock, but with a smaller window into time passing.
